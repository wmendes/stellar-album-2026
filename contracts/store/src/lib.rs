#![no_std]
//! Store — buy sealed packs with Coin (Class 4).
//!
//! Closes the economic loop: the fungible Coin buys the fungible sealed pack.
//! `buy_pack` pulls the price from the buyer (to the treasury) and mints one
//! pack to them. It composes the whole left half of the graph:
//! Coin (pay) + Pack (mint), with the Store as Pack's minter.
